# Optical-dynamics-of-a-negative-refractive-index-G-mb-c-under-neutrino-flux.
Matematical physics problem refering to Gömböc, negative-refractive index metamaterials, reversed Vavilov-Cherenkov effect and neutrino physics

Problem: > Consider a Gömböc (a convex, mono-monostatic body) constructed from a metamaterial with a negative refractive index ($n < 0$).The object is irradiated by a high-density neutrino flux.The neutrinos interact with the medium to produce photons (e.g., via Cherenkov radiation or other mechanisms).Question: > How would the negative refractive index affect the propagation and escape of these photons? Furthermore, would the resulting radiation pressure or momentum transfer affect the unique equilibrium properties (self-righting behavior) of the Gömböc?
