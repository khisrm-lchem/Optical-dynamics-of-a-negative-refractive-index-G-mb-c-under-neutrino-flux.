# Optical dynamics of a negative refractive index Gömböc under neutrino flux
Matematical physics problem refering to Gömböc, negative-refractive index metamaterials, reversed Vavilov-Cherenkov effect and neutrino physics

# Problem 
Consider a Gömböc (a convex, mono-monostatic body) constructed from a metamaterial with a negative refractive index ($n < 0$).The object is irradiated by a high-density neutrino flux.The neutrinos interact with the medium to produce photons (e.g., via Cherenkov radiation or other mechanisms).

# Question 
How would the negative refractive index affect the propagation and escape of these photons? Furthermore, would the resulting radiation pressure or momentum transfer affect the unique equilibrium properties (self-righting behavior) of the Gömböc?

## On the Stability and Phase Dynamics of a Mono-monostatic Convex Body with Inverted Optical Metric
## I. Definition of the Object (The Gömböc Structure)
Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a compact convex body belonging to the class of mono-monostatic shapes. By definition, under a uniform gravitational potential, the height function $h: \partial K \to \mathbb{R}$ possesses exactly two critical points: one stable and one unstable equilibrium.
## II. The Internal Metric and Wave Propagation
The interior $\mathring{K}$ is endowed with a constitutive elective structure equivalent to a Riemannian manifold with a negative refractive index ($n < 0$). This induces a transformation of the light cone such that the phase velocity and the energy flow (Poynting vector) are anti-parallel.
## III. Formulation of the Neutrino-Induced Excitation
We consider a continuous, filtered flux of neutrinos $\Psi$ (modeled as a flow of particles along Euclidean geodesics) passing through $K$. Due to the condition $v_{\Psi} > c/|n|$, a secondary bosonic field $\Xi$ (photons) is generated via the reversed Vavilov-Cherenkov effect. Unlike the standard case, the radiation cone is oriented backwards relative to the direction of the flux.
## IV. Key Research Questions
1. Dynamic Stability:
   Under the influence of the internal radiation pressure $\Pi$ (generated by field $\Xi$), how does the equilibrium topology of $K$ evolve? Does the mono-monostatic property remain invariant under the non-linear coupling of the internal photon gas and the gravitational potential?
3. Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC):
   Given that $K$ acts as a topological resonator for the reversed Cherenkov modes, is there a critical density of field $\Xi$ at which the system undergoes a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate? Specifically, can the "cooling" effect of the reversed emission facilitate a macroscopic quantum state within the metamaterial lattice?
4. Topological Invariants:
   Can the stability of this system be formulated as a problem of symplectic billiards, where the boundary $\partial K$ and the metric $g$ (for $n < 0$) define a unique set of invariant tori in the phase space?
